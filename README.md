# Bayesian-IV-Models-with-Variable-Selection-in-R
This repository contains the code and resources for my research project for my master degree: "Bayesian Analysis of Linear Models with Endogeneity using Instrumental Variables". The project implements and compares several Bayesian models in R to address endogeneity and perform variable selection.
